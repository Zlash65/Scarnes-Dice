# Scarne's Dice

Here is a fully functional android app which I made in Google Applied CS with android program. 
Scarne's Dice is a turn-based dice game where players score points by rolling dice. 

#Rules of Game

The game will be played between computer and user.
if they roll a 1, score no points and lose their turn

choose to either reroll or keep their score and end their turn
The winner is the first player that reaches (or exceeds) 100 points.
